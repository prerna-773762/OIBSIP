						The Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Programme of Walchand Institute of Technology 
                        was established in the year 1999 with an intake of 40 seats. 
                        In 2002, the intake was increased to 60 seats while in 2010, the total intake of 120 seats was sanctioned.
                         With the rapid advancement of the computer age and cybernetics, the boundaries between different branches of engineering have been steadily diminishing, particularly in the realm of “soft” engineering branches such as ‘ Electronics ‘, ‘ Electronics & Telecommunication ‘ and ‘ Computer Science & Engineering ‘.
